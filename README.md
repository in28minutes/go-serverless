## Course Overview

Building Serverless Applications in AWS and Azure is a lot of fun. 

We will start with understanding the fundamentals of building Serverless REST API in AWS with Lambda Functions and API Gateway. You will learn to monitor, version and configure your AWS Lambda Functions. You will learn to build your REST API using API Gateway. We will explore the two important types of API Gateway in depth - HTTP API and REST API. You will learn to implement validation, rate limiting and multiple stages with AWS API Gateway.

After that, we switch our focus to deploying a full stack todo management application with a Serverless approach in AWS. We will use Amazon DynamoDB to store our todos. We will build our REST API using Lambda Functions and API Gateway. We will deploy our Front end application as a static website to Amazon S3. We will use Amazon Cognito to manage and authenticate our users.

Building Lambda Functions and configuring API Gateway manually is a pain. We will learn to automate building Serverless applications in AWS with Serverless Framework and Serverless Application Model. We will build and deploy a complete Serverless REST API (AWS Lambda + API Gateway + Amazon DynamoDB) with Serverless Framework and Serverless Application Model.

This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to Serverless in AWS and Azure.

You will be using AWS Lambda (Serverless Functions), API Gateway (API Management), Amazon DynamoDB (Database), Amazon S3 (to deploy frontend application), Amazon Cognito (Authentication and Authorization), Azure Functions (Serverless Functions), Azure API Management and Azure AD B2C (Authentication). We will be using Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
